binfmt-support 2.2.1 (17 April 2020)
====================================

Fix wrongly-documented "fix_binary" format entry.  Thanks to Helmut Grohne.

Ensure that standard I/O streams are open on program startup.

Fix build with gcc -fno-common.

Improve some internal data structures.

binfmt-support 2.2.0 (24 January 2019)
======================================

Remove support for the old procfs interface, which has been unused since
Linux 2.4.13 and which caused trouble in environments where we can't use
modprobe.  Thanks to Bastian Blank.

Sort formats by name in the output of "update-binfmts --display".

Building binfmt-support now requires Autoconf >= 2.63.

Add a new --unimport action, which is the inverse of --import.

Don't enable formats on import or disable them on unimport unless
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc is already mounted.  This avoids causing cleanup
problems in chroots.

"--fix-binary yes" is incompatible with detectors.  Warn the user if they
try to use both at once.  Thanks to Stefan Agner.

binfmt-support 2.1.8 (22 August 2017)
=====================================

Add --disable-upstart and --disable-systemd configure options.

binfmt-support 2.1.7 (9 July 2017)
==================================

Add an "update-binfmts --fix-binary yes" option, mapping to the 'F' flag in
Linux binfmt_misc's flags field.  Thanks to Dan Nicholson.

binfmt-support 2.1.6 (21 February 2016)
=======================================

Always install database entry even if /proc entry exists.  Thanks to RaphaÃ«l
Hertzog.

Implement a stop action for the systemd service.  Thanks to Michael Biebl.

binfmt-support 2.1.5 (24 August 2014)
=====================================

Add an "update-binfmts --preserve yes" option, mapping to the 'P' flag in
Linux binfmt_misc's flags field.  Thanks to Riku Voipio.

binfmt-support 2.1.4 (30 March 2014)
====================================

Fix test suite when libexecdir is not /usr/lib.

Fix --disable-sysvinit and --disable-openrc configure options.

Make the Upstart job a service with pre-start and post-stop stanzas rather
than a task, as a task with a corresponding init script prevents startpar
from continuing the boot sequence past that init script (because the job is
considered "stopped").  Thanks to Cameron Norman.

binfmt-support 2.1.3 (8 February 2014)
======================================

Fix reversed logic in OpenRC script.

binfmt-support 2.1.2 (7 February 2014)
======================================

Stop hardcoding Debian defaults for various directories.

Ensure all necessary directories exist after installation.

Embed full path to update-binfmts into the sample sysvinit script and the
Upstart job file (the systemd unit file already did this), to save a path
lookup.

Add OpenRC support.

Add mutually-exclusive --enable-sysvinit and --enable-openrc configure
options, which cause the sysvinit or OpenRC script respectively to be
installed to $sysconfdir/init.d/binfmt-support.

binfmt-support 2.1.1 (29 December 2013)
=======================================

Fix installation of systemd unit files.

binfmt-support 2.1.0 (29 December 2013)
=======================================

First separate upstream release, based on previous versions in Debian.

Add a systemd unit file.
